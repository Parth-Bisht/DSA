/*
In this question, we are given a 2D matrix, such that we have to print the spiral traversal of the matrix.
First we have to move along the left-most unvisited column, followed by the bottom-most unvisited column,
followed by the right-most unvisited column, and finally traversing the top-most unvisited row of the matrix.
The important thing here is to modify the boundaries, every time a row or column is visited. This is to be done till
the point, all the elements in the matrix are visited.

Sample Input:
3 4
1 2 3 4
5 6 7 8
9 10 11 12

Sample Output:
1 5 9 10 11 12 8 4 3 2 6 7
