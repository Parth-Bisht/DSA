/*
An ugly number is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.

Given an integer n, return true if n is an ugly number.

Input: n = 6
Output: true
Explanation: 6 = 2 Ã— 3

Input: n = 1
Output: true
Explanation: 1 has no prime factors, therefore all of its prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.

Input: n = 14
Output: false
Explanation: 14 is not ugly since it includes the prime factor 7.
