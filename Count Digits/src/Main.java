/*
You are given an array, stored in a variable with the size arr
The size of the array is stored in a variable with the name n
You have to find the count of 0's ,1's and 2's
For example, consider the array as arr = [0 1 0 2 1 2 0 1 2 0], and the value stored in n = 10
Then, the required output will be 4,3,3 , as no. of 0's are 4, no. of 1's are 3, and no. of 2's are 3.

Sample input:
10
0 1 0 1 1 1 0 2 2 0

output:
4 4 2
