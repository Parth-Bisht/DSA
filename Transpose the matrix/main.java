/*
The transpose of a matrix is an operator which flips a matrix over its diagonal,
that is it switches the row and column of the matrix by producing another matrix.

See sample test case for better understanding

So, given an array of n rows and m columns, generate the transpose of the matrix.

sample input:
5 4
0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1
2 2 2 2
3 3 3 3
4 4 4 4

sample output:
0 1 2 3 4
0 1 2 3 4
0 1 2 3 4
0 1 2 3 4
